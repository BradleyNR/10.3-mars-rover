## Mars Photo Viewer

A small project made with React that pulls data from NASA's Mars Rover API found here:   https://api.nasa.gov/api.html

---

The photos will update dynamically each time a setting is changed. Update the Rover, the Camera Type,  
and the Martian Sol Date and you will be able to find photos from that period. Also remember, not all  
days have photos.
